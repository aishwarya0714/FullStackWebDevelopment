# Build Your Own API 🚀

" The reason why we use APIs because they make develpoment so much fast. Insted of building out everything from sratch and collecting data, cleaning dta or building up services,you can leverage other people's existing data, their services or their algorithmss in order to build a product on top of that existing API.

## 💡 Why REST API?

- 🖊️ Number one rule for making an API restful is that it uses standard HTTP methods. 
- 🖊️ It have standard data format that it responds with that is JSON format.
- 🖊️ Client-Server: both are seperate they are not on same system or same file. and they are able to message each other.
- 🖊️ Stateless: it means that each single request can be complete and each single response is also complete without need to know what happened previously.
- 🖊️ Resource-based: uses uri or url tp locate specific resources.
