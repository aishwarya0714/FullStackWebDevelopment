* APIs:
1. REST API
2. SOAP

For web REST APIs are mostly used. It uses HTTP protocols.

# API Authentication

 0. No authentication
 1. Basic Authentication
 2. API Key Authorization
 3. Token Based Authentication

### 0. No authentication

* public api
* accessible to everyone

### 1. Basic Authentication

* For example, your are providing your user name and passward to access the API with API provider
* It involves Base64 Encoding - taking text (ASCII) that can be converted into bit then encoding it into charachter

# 2. API Key Authorization

- API Key allows you to use api.

# 3. Token Based Authentication

- it is more secure because essentially we're getting the user to use a username and pwd to log in and then once they've logged in, we generate a token to be used with API so the API douesnt get involved with username and pwd and instead its the token thats constantly being used to interact with API.
