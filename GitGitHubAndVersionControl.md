# Git Github and Version Control ðŸš€

# 1. Version Control

Let's learn Version control step by step ðŸ’¡

1. Go to terminal in VS code
2. create new directory
   - mkdir Story
3. Go inside your directory
   - $ cd Story/
4. Now create one Chapert1.txt file
   -$ touch Chapter1.txt
5. Open file in VS code and write something inside that
   - $ code Chapter1.txt
6. Now initiate git repository
   - $ git init
7. to check your git repository
   - $ ls -a
     -a shows all hiden files
8. at this stage your file is in working directory, we need to add it in staging area, for that first will check the status-
   - $ git status
--------------------------------------
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)     
        Chapter1.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
--------------------------------------

will get output like this, means our file is still in working directory not in staging area.
